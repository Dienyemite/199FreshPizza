Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js App Router Project

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js pizza ordering website.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package using npm
- Version installed: latest available from npm registry

### 2. Modified Files

**app/layout.tsx**
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next'`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after the `<CartProvider>{children}</CartProvider>` component
- Preserved all existing functionality including metadata, structured data, Google Analytics scripts, and cart context provider

**package.json**
- Added `@vercel/analytics` to dependencies

**package-lock.json**
- Updated with new dependency tree for @vercel/analytics and its dependencies (178 packages total)

## Implementation Details
- This is an App Router project (Next.js 14.2.35 with TypeScript)
- The Analytics component was added to the root layout file (app/layout.tsx) as per Vercel's recommended approach
- Placement after {children} ensures analytics tracking loads after page content
- All existing code structure was preserved, including fonts, metadata, structured data, and Google Analytics integration

## Verification Steps Completed
✅ Package successfully installed via npm
✅ Build completed successfully - no TypeScript or build errors
✅ Production build generated without issues (12 routes compiled)
✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Notes
- The project uses npm as the package manager (package-lock.json present)
- ESLint is not currently installed in the project, so linting could not be verified, but build succeeded
- The Analytics component will automatically start tracking page views and web vitals once deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is needed; the component works out of the box
